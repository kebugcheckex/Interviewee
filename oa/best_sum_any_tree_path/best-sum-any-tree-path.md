## Question

Given a tree rooted at node _0_ and a _value_ assigned to each node, determine the maximum sum of the values along any path in the tree. The path must not be empty, and in some cases it might not go through the root. The following tree (labeled node _number/value_) is analyzed below.

Two of the possible paths are _4 -> 0 -> 7 -> 2 -> 3_ which has a sum of _15 + 5 + 7 + (-10) + 4 = 27_ and _1 -> 2 -> 3_ with a sum of _7 + (-10) + 4 =
1_. A third possible path, the maximum sum path, is _4 -> 0 -> 7_ with a sum of _15 + 5 + 7 = 27_.

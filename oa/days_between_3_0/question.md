# Days Between 3.0

Write a function, `DaysBetween`, which returns an integer representing the number of days between two dates.

Each date is represented by three integers: year, month (1-12), day (1-31). The first date is guaranteed to occur before the second date. We also have provided a function, `DaysInMonth`, which returns an integer representing the number of days in a month given two integer parameters: month and year. Do not use system provided Date objects. We are testing _your_ implementation, not the system's.

Example: `DaysBetween(2010, 5, 1, 2011, 5, 1)` returns 365.
